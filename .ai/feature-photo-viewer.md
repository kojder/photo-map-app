# Photo Viewer Feature - Fullscreen Photo Browser

**Status:** ‚úÖ Phase 1-5.1 Complete (Ready for Deployment)  
**Branch:** `feature/photo-viewer`  
**Created:** 2025-10-25  
**Estimated Time:** 8-10h | **Time Spent:** ~6h  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-25

## üéØ Feature Overview

### User Story
**As a user**, I want to view photos in fullscreen mode with keyboard/touch navigation, **so that** I can browse through filtered photos without returning to gallery/map view.

### Key Requirements

**Triggers:**
- Click on photo thumbnail in Gallery
- Click on photo thumbnail in Map popup

**Fullscreen Viewer Experience:**
- Photo fills entire screen (100vw x 100vh)
- `object-fit: contain` ‚Üí preserves aspect ratio (black bars if needed)
- Clean immersive mode - no visible UI elements
- Navigation controls appear only on hover (desktop) or after tap (mobile)

**Navigation:**
- **Desktop:** Arrow keys (‚Üê ‚Üí) to navigate, ESC to close
- **Mobile:** Swipe left/right to navigate, tap center to close
- Context: navigates only through photos from current filter
- Always returns to source view (Gallery or Map)

**Exit:**
- Desktop: ESC key
- Mobile: Tap on center of photo
- Returns to previous route (`/gallery` or `/map`) with preserved state

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Components
1. **PhotoViewerComponent** - Fullscreen overlay with photo display
2. **PhotoViewerService** - State management (photos list, current index, source route)

### Data Flow
```
User clicks photo in Gallery
  ‚Üì
GalleryComponent.onPhotoClick(photoId)
  ‚Üì
PhotoViewerService.openViewer(photos$, photoId, '/gallery')
  ‚Üì
PhotoViewerComponent displays photo fullscreen
  ‚Üì
User presses ‚Üí arrow
  ‚Üì
PhotoViewerComponent.nextPhoto()
  ‚Üì
Loads next photo from filtered list
  ‚Üì
User presses ESC
  ‚Üì
Router.navigate('/gallery') ‚Üê Returns to source
```

### Key Design Decisions

**No Browser Fullscreen API:**
- Use CSS `position: fixed` + `z-index: 9999`
- Simpler, more controllable, works everywhere
- Avoids browser compatibility issues

**Photo Size:**
- Load from `/api/photos/{id}/full` endpoint
- Returns `large` size (800px) from backend
- Good balance: quality vs loading time

**State Management:**
- PhotoViewerService with BehaviorSubject pattern
- Stores: photos array, currentIndex, sourceRoute
- Components subscribe to `viewerState$`

**Source Route Tracking:**
- Service stores `/gallery` or `/map` when opening viewer
- Router.navigate(sourceRoute) when closing
- Preserves scroll position and filter state

### Phase 5: UX Enhancements ‚è∏Ô∏è

**Status:** ‚è∏Ô∏è Postponed (Awaiting mobile deployment testing)  
**Time:** ~2h estimated  
**Note:** Phase 5.1 (Loading States) partially completed - spinner with delay and no fade-in implemented. Remaining tasks postponed until mobile testing on production server (mikrus) is possible.

**Tasks:**
- [x] Loading States (Phase 5.1 - Completed)
  - [x] Show spinner while loading full-size photo (200ms delay to prevent flicker)
  - [x] Removed fade-in animation to fix mobile flickering
  - [ ] ‚è∏Ô∏è Loading progress indicator (postponed)
  
- [ ] ‚è∏Ô∏è Preloading Strategy (Phase 5.2)
  
- [ ] ‚è∏Ô∏è Preloading Strategy (Phase 5.2)
  - [ ] Preload next photo when viewer opens
  - [ ] Preload previous photo after 1 second
  - [ ] Cache blob URLs in service
  - [ ] Clean up blob URLs on viewer close
  
- [ ] ‚è∏Ô∏è Transition Animations (Phase 5.3)
  - [ ] Fade in/out on open/close
  - [ ] Slide animation between photos (optional)
  - [ ] Smooth navigation button appearance
  
- [ ] ‚è∏Ô∏è Error Handling (Phase 5.4)
  - [ ] Handle 404 when photo file missing
  - [ ] Show error message if load fails
  - [ ] Allow navigation even if current photo fails
  - [ ] Retry button for failed loads
  
- [ ] ‚è∏Ô∏è Accessibility (Phase 5.5)
  - [ ] ARIA labels on navigation buttons
  - [ ] Keyboard focus management
  - [ ] Screen reader announcements
  
- [ ] ‚è∏Ô∏è Polish (Phase 5.6)
  - [ ] Photo metadata in footer (filename, date, rating)
  - [ ] Smooth hover effects

**Postponement Reason:**
- Mobile testing requires deployment to production server (mikrus)
- Current testing limited to DevTools emulation (not representative of real mobile performance)
- Will resume Phase 5 tasks after deployment when real mobile testing is possible

**Acceptance Criteria (when resumed):**
- ‚úÖ Loading spinner shows while photo loads (completed)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Next/prev photos preloaded for instant navigation
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Smooth animations between states
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Error states handled gracefully
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Keyboard accessible (focus visible, logical tab order)

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Required)
- `PhotoViewerComponent.spec.ts` (keyboard, navigation, boundaries)
- `PhotoViewerService.spec.ts` (state management, routing)
- `PhotoController` (backend endpoint test)

**Target Coverage:** >70% for new code

### Integration Tests
- Gallery ‚Üí Viewer ‚Üí Navigation ‚Üí Close flow
- Map ‚Üí Viewer ‚Üí Navigation ‚Üí Close flow
- Filter changes reflected in viewer photo list

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Desktop: keyboard navigation (arrows, ESC)
- [ ] Desktop: mouse clicks on navigation buttons
- [ ] Desktop: hover effects on controls
- [ ] Mobile: swipe left/right gestures
- [ ] Mobile: tap-to-close on center
- [ ] Mobile: touch targets large enough
- [ ] Different photo sizes (portrait, landscape, square)
- [ ] Filtered photo sets (verify only filtered photos shown)
- [ ] Return to source (gallery vs map routing)
- [ ] Browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### Chrome DevTools MCP Verification
- [ ] Mobile viewport testing (iPhone, Android sizes)
- [ ] Touch event simulation
- [ ] Network throttling (slow 3G - test loading states)
- [ ] Console error check
- [ ] Performance profiling

## üìù Technical Decisions Log

### Decision 1: CSS Fixed Position vs Browser Fullscreen API
**Choice:** CSS `position: fixed` with `z-index: 9999`  
**Reasoning:**
- Simpler implementation
- Better cross-browser compatibility
- More control over UI elements
- Avoids browser chrome differences

### Decision 2: Photo Size to Load
**Choice:** Load from `large/` directory (800px)  
**Reasoning:**
- Good balance between quality and file size
- Fast loading even on mobile networks
- Original files can be very large (5-10MB)
- Can add "view original" button in future if needed

### Decision 3: State Management Pattern
**Choice:** BehaviorSubject in PhotoViewerService  
**Reasoning:**
- Consistent with existing PhotoService and FilterService
- No external dependencies (no NgRx)
- Simple for this use case
- Easy to test

### Decision 4: Source Route Tracking
**Choice:** Store sourceRoute in ViewerState  
**Reasoning:**
- Allows proper back navigation
- Preserves filter/scroll state
- Simple Router.navigate() on close
- User-friendly experience

### Decision 6: Loading States Without Fade-in
**Choice:** Spinner with 200ms delay, no fade-in animation  
**Reasoning:**
- 200ms delay prevents spinner flicker on fast connections
- Removed fade-in animation to eliminate mobile flickering
- Instant photo display provides better UX than animated transitions
- Simpler implementation, less CPU usage on mobile

### Decision 7: Mobile Button Tap Handling
**Choice:** Separate touch target detection + stopPropagation on buttons  
**Reasoning:**
- Prevents navigation buttons from triggering tap-to-close
- Uses `touchStartTarget` to identify button taps vs image taps
- stopPropagation ensures button clicks work independently
- Maintains swipe gesture functionality
