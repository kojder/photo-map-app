# Photo Viewer Feature - Fullscreen Photo Browser

**Status:** üîú Not started  
**Branch:** `feature/photo-viewer`  
**Created:** 2025-10-25  
**Estimated Time:** 8-10h  

---

## üéØ Feature Overview

### User Story
**As a user**, I want to view photos in fullscreen mode with keyboard/touch navigation, **so that** I can browse through filtered photos without returning to gallery/map view.

### Key Requirements

**Triggers:**
- Click on photo thumbnail in Gallery
- Click on photo thumbnail in Map popup

**Fullscreen Viewer Experience:**
- Photo fills entire screen (100vw x 100vh)
- `object-fit: contain` ‚Üí preserves aspect ratio (black bars if needed)
- Clean immersive mode - no visible UI elements
- Navigation controls appear only on hover (desktop) or after tap (mobile)

**Navigation:**
- **Desktop:** Arrow keys (‚Üê ‚Üí) to navigate, ESC to close
- **Mobile:** Swipe left/right to navigate, tap center to close
- Context: navigates only through photos from current filter
- Always returns to source view (Gallery or Map)

**Exit:**
- Desktop: ESC key
- Mobile: Tap on center of photo
- Returns to previous route (`/gallery` or `/map`) with preserved state

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Components
1. **PhotoViewerComponent** - Fullscreen overlay with photo display
2. **PhotoViewerService** - State management (photos list, current index, source route)

### Data Flow
```
User clicks photo in Gallery
  ‚Üì
GalleryComponent.onPhotoClick(photoId)
  ‚Üì
PhotoViewerService.openViewer(photos$, photoId, '/gallery')
  ‚Üì
PhotoViewerComponent displays photo fullscreen
  ‚Üì
User presses ‚Üí arrow
  ‚Üì
PhotoViewerComponent.nextPhoto()
  ‚Üì
Loads next photo from filtered list
  ‚Üì
User presses ESC
  ‚Üì
Router.navigate('/gallery') ‚Üê Returns to source
```

### Key Design Decisions

**No Browser Fullscreen API:**
- Use CSS `position: fixed` + `z-index: 9999`
- Simpler, more controllable, works everywhere
- Avoids browser compatibility issues

**Photo Size:**
- Load from `/api/photos/{id}/full` endpoint
- Returns `large` size (800px) from backend
- Good balance: quality vs loading time

**State Management:**
- PhotoViewerService with BehaviorSubject pattern
- Stores: photos array, currentIndex, sourceRoute
- Components subscribe to `viewerState$`

**Source Route Tracking:**
- Service stores `/gallery` or `/map` when opening viewer
- Router.navigate(sourceRoute) when closing
- Preserves scroll position and filter state

## üìã Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Viewer Component ‚úÖ

**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed (2025-10-25)  
**Time:** ~1.5h  

**Tasks:**
- [x] Create `PhotoViewerComponent` (standalone)
  - [x] Template: fullscreen overlay with image element
  - [x] CSS: `position: fixed`, `object-fit: contain`, black background
  - [x] Keyboard listeners: ESC (close), ArrowLeft (prev), ArrowRight (next)
  - [x] Navigation buttons (‚Äπ ‚Ä∫ arrows) - visible only on hover
  - [x] Footer with counter (e.g., "3 / 24")
  
- [x] Create `PhotoViewerService`
  - [x] `ViewerState` interface (isOpen, photos, currentIndex, sourceRoute)
  - [x] BehaviorSubject for state management
  - [x] `openViewer(photos, photoId, sourceRoute)` method
  - [x] `closeViewer()` method ‚Üí Router.navigate(sourceRoute)
  - [x] `nextPhoto()` / `previousPhoto()` methods
  - [x] Boundary checks (first/last photo)
  
- [x] Backend: Updated `/api/photos/{id}/full` endpoint
  - [x] Changed from `originalDirectory` to `largeDirectory` (800px)
  - [x] Added proper content-type detection via `Files.probeContentType()`
  - [x] Error handling (404 if file not found)
  
- [x] Unit Tests
  - [x] `PhotoViewerComponent.spec.ts` (36 tests total passing)

    - [x] Test boundary conditions (first/last photo)
    - [x] Test navigation button clicks
    - [x] Test template rendering
  - [x] `PhotoViewerService.spec.ts`
    - [x] Test state management (BehaviorSubject emissions)
    - [x] Test openViewer/closeViewer flow

## üìù Technical Decisions Log

### Decision 1: CSS Fixed Position vs Browser Fullscreen API
**Choice:** CSS `position: fixed` with `z-index: 9999`  
**Reasoning:**
- Simpler implementation
- Better cross-browser compatibility
- More control over UI elements
- Avoids browser chrome differences

### Decision 2: Photo Size to Load
**Choice:** Load from `large/` directory (800px)  
**Reasoning:**
- Good balance between quality and file size
- Fast loading even on mobile networks
- Original files can be very large (5-10MB)
- Can add "view original" button in future if needed

### Decision 3: State Management Pattern
**Choice:** BehaviorSubject in PhotoViewerService  
**Reasoning:**
- Consistent with existing PhotoService and FilterService
- No external dependencies (no NgRx)
- Simple for this use case
- Easy to test

### Decision 4: Source Route Tracking
**Choice:** Store sourceRoute in ViewerState  
**Reasoning:**
- Allows proper back navigation
- Preserves filter/scroll state
- Simple Router.navigate() on close
- User-friendly experience

### Decision 5: Mobile Gesture Threshold
**Choice:** 50px minimum swipe distance  
**Reasoning:**
- Prevents accidental navigation
- Industry standard (based on iOS/Android guidelines)
- Tested in similar apps (Instagram, Google Photos)
